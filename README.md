# Team 3123 - Spontaneous Combustion Code for the 22-23 Season
First Tech Challenge Team 3123 Spontaneous Combustion is actively participating in the First Tech Challenge program, a robotics competition for students in middle and high school. The team is made up of dedicated students who are passionate about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. They are working hard to design, build, and program a robot that can compete in the annual FTC competition. The team members are also learning valuable skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication while they work on their robot. They are excited to showcase their hard work and compete against other teams from around the country.
